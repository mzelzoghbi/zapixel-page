  # ZaPixel Landing Page Design

  This is a code bundle for ZaPixel Landing Page Design. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/a5ifz5uV5reoGi6Pcb1ngu/ZaPixel-Landing-Page-Design.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

  ## Deploying to GitHub Pages

  1. Ensure your default branch is `main` (or update the workflow trigger if different).
  2. Push to `main`; the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will build the site and publish to Pages using the `build/` output.
  3. In your repo settings, enable GitHub Pages and choose **Source: GitHub Actions**.
  4. The deployed site will be available at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo-name>/` (the base path is set automatically during the build).
